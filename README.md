# Portfolio-Risk-Analysis-VAR-Analysis
Portfolio Risk Analysis
Overview
This project analyzes portfolio risk by calculating Value at Risk (VaR) using Monte Carlo simulations and historical data from Yahoo Finance. It also visualizes portfolio risk exposure and generates risk alerts.

What I Did
Fetched historical stock prices for a client portfolio (AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL).
Calculated daily returns and portfolio weights.
Implemented Monte Carlo Simulation to estimate 95% VaR.
Used historical data to compute another 95% VaR.
Visualized risk distribution using histograms.
Generated a risk alert if VaR exceeded 2% of portfolio value.
Libraries Used
The following Python libraries were included in the project:

numpy – for numerical calculations.
pandas – for handling financial data.
yfinance – for fetching stock price data.
matplotlib – for plotting graphs.
seaborn – for enhanced data visualization.
